#-----------Note-----
#We see that our R-Squared Multiple is 95% is high, which means that
#our model fits well with the real data, given that it is almost 100%.
#Our P value is very close to 0, it could indicate that there is a
#significant difference between the data sets, although it is striking 
#that it is so small.
